# Effects as data: what Cure still decides in code

Goal: an effect is fully described by data (its *description*), and one generic runtime (a host
DLL Fujin ships) builds and runs any description. A new effect is then a new description, with no
code written for it. The test of success: Cure and Potion produced from their descriptions alone
pass the existing port-equality tests (frame by frame against the original code), then Hypnotize,
whose parts are different, does too.

This file audits the FFNx port of Cure (`src/ff8/battle/fx/mag001_cure.cpp` and
`mag_heal_ring.h` on VanillaDecompiledStructRework; Potion's port is the same code with other
values) and lists every decision that no parameter covers yet, then sketches the description that
would cover them.

## What the parameters cover today

`HealRingParams` (about 100 fields, one struct per part) holds the *numbers* of Cure's behaviours:
ticks and windows, spawn counts per tick, speeds and random ranges, radius and climb scales,
colours, sizes, flipbook sequences and last frames, the sound and its tick and pan, the projected
image's VRAM place and window, the glint style. Every number the task code reads is one of them.

What they do not cover is everything below: which parts exist, how they are linked, which law
each part follows, what it is measured against, how it is drawn, where its resources come from,
and the engine work around it.

## A. Structure: which parts exist, who spawns whom (all code)

| Decision | Where | Today |
|---|---|---|
| The effect is a root (director) task, emitters, particles (ring, sparkles, motes) and glints, in three queues | Init (exe), `RootTask` | code |
| One emitter per action, in turn: the root spawns it (phase 3), waits until the ring clears `busy` (phase 4), goes to the next action, last = max(target count - 1, action count - 1) | `RootPhase` 3-4, Init | code |
| The root ends once all three queues are empty (phase 6), then done (9) | `RootPhase` | code |
| The emitter spawns the ring (after `ring.start.delay`) | `EmitterTask` phase 0 | code + param |
| The ring spawns a sparkle at each step, motes and glints per tick, while its "spawning" flag is on (from its init to its end) | `RingTask`, `Ring_Spawn*` | code + params |
| The glow and the overlay are drawn by the ring itself, not separate tasks | `RingTask` | code |
| A task ends when flagged done and it has no live children (child counts through the parent) | every task | code (engine rule) |
| Pool sizes: 2 roots x 0x64, 4 emitters x 0x58, 300 particles x 0x6C, 100 glints x 0x5C | Init (exe) | code |

**Needed in the description:** a list of parts, each with a kind, the part that spawns it, and a
spawn rule (at tick, per step, count schedule per tick, once per action), plus the director's
"one target after another" rule as a director kind.

## B. Behaviours: how each part moves and lives (code, numbers are params)

| Part | Law | Today |
|---|---|---|
| Root | phases 0..10 above; follows the caster's bones every tick | code |
| Emitter | follows the target's anchor and model bounds every tick; sound at `sound_tick`; HP given at `heal_tick` (`ApplyActionResultToTarget`); done | code + params |
| Ring | phase 0 init; phase 1 waits for `ending.tick`, switches to the ending flipbook; phase 2 runs it to its last frame, then clears the root's `busy`, unhides the target, stops spawning and the overlay, done | code + params |
| Ring position | helix: `centre + (sin, cos)(n x angle) x radius`, `y = centre + n x climb`, recomputed from the counter at every step `n` | code (`RingPlace`) |
| Sparkle | at birth a random velocity per axis (x, z, y), then position += velocity each tick until the flipbook's last frame | code + params |
| Mote | born on a circle around the target at a random angle, below the ring by a random share of its height over the target's top; rises at a random speed; flipbook to its last frame | code + params |
| Glint | the shared effect-library glint task (grow, shrink, spin left or right at random) | code (`fx_glint.cpp`) + params |
| Glow | while ring tick < `ticks`: grey = start - tick x fade, one byte (wraps) | code + params |
| Overlay | on while the ring's flag 8 is set (ring init to ring end); the target is hidden (entity flag 4) and redrawn by it | code |
| Lifetime | flipbook frame +1 per tick; past the last frame: hidden, done | code |

**Needed:** a library of behaviour kinds, each with its own parameters: `director_per_action`,
`follow_target`, `helix_climb`, `burst_then_drift` (random velocity then integrate),
`spawn_on_circle_rise`, `glint`, `fade_glow`, `flipbook_life`, and phase rules
("at tick T switch flipbook", "at flipbook end do X").

## C. Inputs: what each value is measured against (code)

| Value | Measured from | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Ring centre x / z | the target's anchor (`CopyAnchorXZFromSource`) | `Ring_State0_Init` |
| Ring start y | the target's bounds max y (`BoundsMaxWorldY`, the feet: y is down) minus `start.above` | `Ring_State0_Init` |
| Ring radius | the target's bounds radius (`BoundsRadius`) | `Ring_State0_Init` |
| Ring climb | the target's bounds height (`BoundsHeight`) | `Ring_State0_Init` |
| Mote circle radius | the target's bounds radius | `Ring_SpawnMotes` |
| Mote height | the ring's y and the target's bounds max y | `Ring_SpawnMotes` |
| Projector position | the ring's position, every tick | `RingTask` |
| Overlay height offset | the ring's y | `RingTask` |
| Root position | the caster's bones | `RootTask` |
| Heal | the action and target the emitter was spawned for | `EmitterTask` |

**Needed:** named inputs (target anchor, bounds top / bottom / radius / height, caster bones,
parent position, part tick, action / target index) a value can be bound to, with the scale and
offset parameters that already exist (`fxp::Scaled`, offsets).

## D. Renderers: how each part is drawn (code)

| Renderer | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Camera-facing flipbook sprite | `DrawSprite` | colour, size, `shade` (depth offset); layer `RenderOT(0x44)` |
| Flipbook frame on a tilted plane on the ground | `DrawAdditiveGlow` | tilt, height, frame, colour from the glow behaviour |
| Projector overlay: the target model redrawn with a projected texture | `DrawTargetModelWithOverlay`, `Overlay_RenderModel`, about 300 lines | shadow first; body and weapon models; projected window, light distance, colour, back-face switch |
| Glint streaks | `fx_glint.cpp` | shared with other effects |

**Needed:** a renderer library chosen by name per part. These four already exist as functions; the
work is giving each a stable interface (inputs: position, flipbook state, colour, size...) instead
of reading Cure's own nodes and globals.

## E. Resources (exe data and fixed names)

| Resource | Today |
|---|---|
| Texture file `mag000-049.tim` (name string at 0x164252C, loaded by `MAG_001_CURE_FL`) | exe, fixed |
| Camera track 0x16417C8 (started by Init) | exe, fixed |
| Five sprite sequences (ring, ring end, glow, sparkle, mote) | params, pointing at exe data |
| Sound block | param, pointing at exe data |
| Projected image (VRAM place, palette, window) | params |

**Needed:** the texture file name and the camera track as description fields (a file, or a
reference to exe data); new sprite sequences and sounds from files (until then only existing ones
can be picked).

## F. Engine work around the effect (code, outside the ported tasks)

1. **Init and the loader are not ported.** FFNx ports the task functions (root, emitter, ring,
   mote, sparkle); `MAG_001_CURE_Init` (queues and pools, the root node, the target loop bounds,
   the camera, the TIM upload, the packet arenas) and `MAG_001_CURE_FL` still run from the exe. A
   new slot has no exe Init, so both must be ported first.
2. **Memory.** The module's memory is Cure's own in the exe (0x277AEC0..0x2792E78: texture file,
   packet cursor and arenas, queues and pools, overlay vertex buffer, sprite block and context) and
   the effect library's glint cursor 0x2792E74 and camera snapshot 0x2793E58. The port reaches it
   through accessors (`PacketCursor()`, `QParticles()`, `Overlay()`...); a host must point them at
   its own memory.
3. **Packet arenas:** two, swapped each tick by the root (`tick & 1`).
4. **Random numbers:** `CrtRand` call order is part of the result: sparkle x, z, y; per mote angle
   then drop; per glint the spin side. A description must keep the order its parts call in.
5. **Integer details** the port keeps for exactness: truncating divisions (`/ -20`, `/ -48`), the
   glow grey wrapping as a byte, the glow colour's 4th byte taken from the node address (a stack
   quirk of the original).
6. **Handshakes:** the root's `busy` flag (set by the root, cleared by the ring), entity flag 4
   (hide / show the target), the heal call.

Potion's description is the same with its own sequences and sound.

## Work, in order

1. **Port Init and the loader** for Cure and Potion, so the whole effect runs from FFNx code, and
   route all module memory through the accessors. Check: the port tests still pass.
2. **Resources as parameters:** texture file name, camera track.
3. **Split the heal ring into the libraries above** (behaviours, renderers, inputs), each with a
   stable interface, Cure rebuilt from them in C++. Check: port tests.
4. **The description format and its loader**, and the runtime that builds an effect from it. Check:
   Cure and Potion from their descriptions alone pass the port tests.
5. **Hypnotize** through the same path, adding what its parts need to the libraries. This measures
   how general the libraries really are.
6. **Fujin:** edit the description (parts, links, bindings) beside the parameters, and write the
   host DLL's files for a free slot (224, 225, 346-400; the game's dispatcher `Magic_GetIDLoad`
   0x50AF20 reads `MagicList_Logic` / `MagicList_TextureLoad` and falls back to slot 0 when empty).
